# movieRecommendationEngine
This is my capstone project for Duke University's five-course specialization Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals.
It is a movie recommendation engine written in Java using the BlueJ environment.  
It reads in info about various movies and also lists of ratings submitted of those movies.
It stores this data in a simplified database and queries it, applying various filters.

The first version used ArrayLists where later versions used HashMaps for efficient search.
