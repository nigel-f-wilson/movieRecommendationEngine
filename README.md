# movieRecommendationEngine
This is my capstone project for Duke University's five-course specialization Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals.
It is a movie recommendation engine written in Java using the BlueJ environment.  
It reads in info about various movies and also lists of ratings submitted of those movies.
It stores this data in a simplified database and queries it, applying various filters.

Early versions used ArrayLists, where Later versions used HashMaps for more efficient search. 
Early versions read data in and stored it as state inside objects with methods for doing things with that data. 
Later versions read data into a simplified database, a separate class.
Separating the data storing and querying functions from the analyis methods and separating those from the tester methods improved reusability and maintainability.
